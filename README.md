# FullStack-Coding-Challenge
This project is a Task Manager and Store Rating Platform where users can register as System Administrators, Store Owners, or Normal Users. System Administrators manage the system, Store Owners manage their stores, and Users can rate stores from 1 to 5 stars, with role-based access control and dashboards for each role.
